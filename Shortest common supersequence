Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of the smallest string which has both s1 and s2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: s1 and s2 can have both uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "eke"
Output: 5
Explanation: String "geeke" has both string "geek" and "eke" as subsequences.
Input: s1 = "AGGTAB", s2 = "GXTXAYB"
Output: 9
Explanation: String "AGXGTXAYB" has both string "AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" as subsequences.
Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "ek"
Output: 4
Explanation: String "geek" has both string "geek" and "ek" as subsequences.

Why is the formula m + n - LCS?
𝑚
+
𝑛
m+n represents the total length if we simply concatenated both strings without considering common characters.
The LCS represents the common characters that appear in both strings without needing duplication.
To avoid counting these common characters twice, we subtract LCS length from m + n.
Example
Input:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
s1 = "abcde"
s2 = "ace"
Step 1: Find LCS
LCS of "abcde" and "ace" is "ace" (length = 3).
Step 2: Apply the Formula
SCS Length

SCS Length=5+3−3=5
SCS String Example: "abcde" (since it already contains "ace" as a subsequence).
