A frog is trying to reach the last stone (stone n - 1) from the first stone (stone 0).
There are n stones, and the height of each stone is given in the array height[] of length n.

The frog can jump either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.
The cost of a jump from stone i to stone j is abs(height[i] - height[j]).

Your task is to compute the minimum total cost to reach the last stone.

Hereâ€™s a 5-line summary with more focus on recursion logic:

The function calculateCost(n, height, dp) recursively computes the minimum cost to reach stone n.
The base case (if n == 0) returns 0 since the frog starts from the first stone.
If the result for n is already computed (dp[n] != -1), it is returned to avoid redundant calculations (memoization).
The recursion explores two options: jumping from n-1 (1 step) and n-2 (2 steps), calculating costs for both.
The minimum of the two costs is stored in dp[n] and returned, ensuring optimal jumps with memoization.

class Solution {
    int minCost(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i < dp.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = -1;
        }
        int minCost = calculateCost(n - 1, height, dp);
        return minCost;
    }
    
    public int calculateCost(int n, int[] height, int[] dp) {
        if(n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp[n] != -1) {
            return dp[n];
        }
        int left = calculateCost(n - 1, height, dp) + Math.abs(height[n] - height[n-1]);
        
        int right = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if(n > 1)
        {
             right = calculateCost(n - 2, height, dp) + Math.abs(height[n] - height[n-2]);
        }
        
        dp[n] = Math.min(left, right); 
        return dp[n];
    }
}
